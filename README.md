Prelude-js
==========

The Haskell base library, Prelude, partially rewritten in Javascript

This is based on the Haskell base library with the same name, Prelude. It aims
to bring the convenience of functional programming to Javascript mostly through
higher-order functions (function composition, currying, maps, filters, folds).
